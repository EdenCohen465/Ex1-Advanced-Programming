# Ex1-Advanced-Programming
We used React.js.
The files are in ex1-advanced-programming folder.
In order to run, download the files (you need the node_modules folder too, but you told us not to upload it), and then write in cmd- npm start.
The downloads we used: react-router-dom, react-bootstrap, (we used bootstrap and bootstrap icon that we linked in index.html).
